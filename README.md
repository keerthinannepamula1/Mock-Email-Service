# Mock-Email-Service
This project implements a resilient JavaScript email service with retry logic, fallback to a secondary provider, idempotency to prevent duplicates, and rate limiting. It includes status tracking, a circuit breaker pattern for failure handling, simple logging, and a basic queue system, ensuring reliable email delivery.
